### Config file for SecurityPi ###
#
#
### GPIO PIN NUMBERING ###
#
#   GPIO pins are used to communicate with sensors. SecurityPi uses
#   the regular numbering scheme as seen on http://pi.gadgetoid.com/pinout
pin.LEDgreen=33
pin.LEDred=37
pin.temperature=7
pin.motion=31
pin.buttonout=11
pin.buttonin=15
#
#
### SENSOR READING ###
#
#   Time interval on regular readings in seconds. Reading intervals
#   should not be to short. This may use a lot of CPU and fill the
#   logfile with unnecessary information.
reading.time=6
#   The temperature sensor is identified by ID. You can find this by
#   looking in /sys/bus/w1/devices/. w1-gpio must be enabled.
reading.temperatureID=28-000006a0858b
#
#
### Server ###
#
#   The IP address of the SecurityPi server. Should be 127.0.0.1 if
#   run locally.
server.ip=192.168.0.1
#   Port number used on server. Standard port is 4142
server.port=4142
#
#
### LOGGING ###
#
#   Path to logfile. Default is /home/USER/securitypi/log/
#   log.path=/path/to/file/
#
#   Name of logfile. Default is log.txt
#   log.name=default.txt
#
#   Max file size of logfile (in kB). If no file size is set, a
#   default of 2048kb will be used. Keep in mind that the system
#   will keep a backup of previous log file. Meaning that the max
#   size used on the system at any given time may be maxsize * 2.
#   If more than one backup file is generated, the oldest one will
#   be deleted.
log.maxsize=2048
