* Report unusual events like
  * Temperatures outside a given range
  * Motion detected when motion detection is on

## What is it not supposed to do?

Be an alarm system. The SecurityPi is used to monitor changes on sensors. It may report those events, but should not be used as an all-in-one security system.

## Progress of project

The project is developed on a hobby-basis. And is supposed to be a learning experience while getting some hands-on experience with the RaspberryPi.
